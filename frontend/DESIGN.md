# Green Deck

## Overview
A bold, dark-first design system built for immersive audio experiences. Green Deck uses a high-energy green accent against deep black and charcoal surfaces to create an atmosphere that feels like a late-night concert venue — electric, focused, and alive. The aesthetic is minimal yet punchy, designed to keep content front and center while the UI recedes into darkness.

## Colors

## Typography
- **Display Font**: DM Sans — loaded from Google Fonts
- **Body Font**: DM Sans — loaded from Google Fonts
- **Code Font**: JetBrains Mono — loaded from Google Fonts

DM Sans is used throughout as a geometric sans-serif that provides the clean, modern feel of a circular typeface. Headlines use weights 700 and 800 with tight tracking for bold, punchy statements. Body text uses weight 400 and 500 for comfortable reading on dark backgrounds. Slightly increased line-height (1.5x) improves legibility against dark surfaces. All text is pure white or light gray — no dark text colors exist in this system.

## Elevation
On dark interfaces, traditional shadows are invisible. Elevation is instead communicated through surface brightness — darker surfaces (#121212) are lower, lighter surfaces (#181818, #282828) are higher. Level 0 uses #121212 (background). Level 1 uses #181818 (cards, sidebar). Level 2 uses #282828 (dropdown menus, context menus). Level 3 uses #333333 (modals, now-playing bar). Hover states lighten the surface by one level. The now-playing bar uses a subtle top border of 1px #282828 plus a gradient shadow: 0 -8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.5).

## Do's and Don'ts
- Do design dark-first — light mode is secondary, never the default
- Do use pure white (#FFFFFF) for primary text on dark surfaces for maximum contrast
- Don't use the green for large surface fills — reserve it for interactive accents and the play button
- Do scale elements on hover (1.04x) for playful, responsive feedback
- Don't use borders to define containers — use surface color differences instead
- Do make the now-playing context persistent and always visible
- Don't use long text blocks — keep copy short, scannable, and label-like
- Do use uppercase tracking (0.1em) sparingly for section labels and overlines only
- Don't use light or white backgrounds anywhere in the primary interface
